    "The volume of unstructured text in existence is growing dramatically, and Spark is an excellent tool for analyzing this type of data.  In this homework, we will write code that calculates the most common words in the [Complete Works of William Shakespeare](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100) retrieved from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page).\n",

This is because reduceByKey() performs the reduction operation first within each partition and then across the partitions, significantly reducing the amount of data that needs to be shuffled across the cluster.
